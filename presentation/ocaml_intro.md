**Platform and Ecosystem**

{pause unreveal="plat-first-part plat-second-part"}

{#plat-first-part}
> - Fast, native code generation — targets x86, ARM, RISC-V, etc. 
> - JavaScript and WebAssembly (via WasmGC) compilation
> - Strong tooling ecosystem — editor integration (LSP), build system (dune), package manager (opam), documentation generator (odoc), etc.
> - Opam repository — small but mature package ecosystem
{#plat-second-part style="margin-top:-30px"}
> - Notable industrial users — Jane Street, Meta, Microsoft, Ahrefs, Citrix, Tezos, Bloomberg, Docker
> - MirageOS — library operating system for building secure, minimal unikernels (cloud and IoT deployments)

**Applications and Strengths**

{change-page="camel-carousel1"}

{change-page="camel-carousel1"}
{pause}
- High dynamic range — OCaml scales from quick scripts and research prototypes to large production systems.
- Compilers & languages — early versions of the Rust compiler, the WebAssembly reference interpreter, and Meta’s Hack language were written in OCaml.
- Frontend development — Ahrefs’ entire frontend is written in OCaml and compiled to JavaScript.
- Systems programming — used in Docker for Mac/Windows for container virtualization; Parsimoni (a Tarides spinoff) launched OCaml-based software into space.
- Hardware design — HardCaml enables FPGA programming in OCaml; it has powered award-winning entries in the ZPrize competition for zero-knowledge cryptography.
