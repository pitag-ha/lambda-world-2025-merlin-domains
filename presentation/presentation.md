Live demo!

{pause}

You've just seen OCamlLSP live. OCamlLSP is one of the two frontends of OCaml's language server backend Merlin üí´üí´ . Let's talk about Merlin:

{#question_frontend}
**Question**: Who here remembers, e.g. from uni, roughly what an AST is and what the compiler frontend does? (lexing, parsing, typing)

{pause up-at-unpause=question_frontend}

An AST is a representation of the program in the form of a tree.

In OCaml, a statically typed language, there are two ASTs:

- **Parsetree**: the raw syntax tree from parsing source code.
- **Typedtree**: a version of the syntax tree where the compiler has annotated every expression with its inferred type.

{pause}

The compiler frontend builds up these different representations of your program step by step. Merlin does the same.

#### Cache mechanisms in Merlin

There are two cache mechanisms:

1. File caches

   - `cmi` cache
     - .cmi files store the compiled interface of an OCaml module (remember the demo). They let the typer see the types of values, functions, and modules defined elsewhere.
     - Merlin keeps the contents of read .cmi files in memory.
     - Thanks to this cache, the 2nd, 3rd‚Ä¶ query in a file is much faster than the first.
   - Other similar file caches

{pause up-at-unpause=typer_cache}

{#typer_cache} 2. Typer cache

{pause}

Remember:

![](typer.svg)

{pause}

{#simplification}
That was overly simplified.

Actually, there's a cache mechanism in between: The next item only gets typed if it hasn't changed since the last time Merlin ran. If not, it gets drawn from cache

{pause}

So: When you modify code near the top of a file, Merlin needs to retype most of the file, so queries are slower.
Changes near the end have little impact as almost all previous typing results can be reused.

{pause}

{#take-away}
**Take-away from the typer cache** üçï: When you modify a long file at the beginning of the file, Merlin is slow. (If you remember the demo, you saw this in action!)

{pause up-at-unpause=take-away}

**Take-away from performance analysis** üç£: The typer is the main performance bottlenecks. The query analysis can also be quite slow. Partly parallelising the two things would help.

{pause}

**Also** ‚ú®‚ûï‚ú®: Currently, Merlin finishes the whole process for one query before starting the next. If there were a way to cancel in-progress work when new queries arrive, queries could respond even faster. LSP does skip queued queries. If Merlin could also cancel ongoing query processing, that‚Äôd be magic!
